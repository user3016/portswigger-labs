SSRF is a vulnerability in web applications that allows a user to modify client side requests to access other servers or services in the internal network.

Exploiting SSRF

##1- Regular / In-Band SSRF:
=> If the application accepts user-supplied URLs:
1. Check if a port number can be specefied.

2. If yes, attempty to port-scan the internal network using burp intruder.

3. Attempt to connect to other services on the loopback address.

=> If the application does not accept user-supplied URLs:
1. try different encoding schemes
=> 127.0.0.1 / localhost / hexadecimal encoding / octal encoding / 127.1 / 127.01 / ::1 / long-to-short ip converter

2. Register a domain name that resolves to internal IP address (DNS Rebinding) inside.sec-down.com

3. Use your own server to redirect to an internal IP address (HTTP Redirection)

4. Exploit URL parser

##2- Blind / Out-of-Band SSRF
1. Attempt to make the vulnerable server send an HTTP/DNS/ICMP request to an external server that you control and then check the logs for any connections.
